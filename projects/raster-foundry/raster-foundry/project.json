Raster Foundry depends heavily on AWS resources and using AWS resources to manage secrets/containers/artifacts in development. If only local development is being done, the primary resource that will be used are S3 buckets to store secrets.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In the AWS account you need to create a few buckets for the following:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>A bucket to house raw data (e.g. geotiffs, JPEG2000, ingest definitions, etc.)</li>\n<li>A config bucket that will store secrets for development and or other environments, an exported database for development data</li>\n<li>A bucket to house processed data (e.g. thumbnails, processed raster RDDs)</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The names of the buckets are not important, but they should be memorable and easy to parse for your own sake. On your host machine you need to set up an AWS profile for the account with the S3 buckets. For instance, to set up an AWS profile called <code>raster-foundry</code> with the AWS cli the following command would be used:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"$ aws configure --profile raster-foundry\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>$ aws configure --profile raster-foundry\n</code></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">You will be prompted for an access key and secret key.</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-heading\" dir=\"auto\"><h4 class=\"heading-element\" dir=\"auto\">Setting Development Environment Variables</h4><a id=\"user-content-setting-development-environment-variables\" class=\"anchor\" aria-label=\"Permalink: Setting Development Environment Variables\" href=\"#setting-development-environment-variables\"><svg class=\"octicon octicon-link\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z\"></path></svg></a></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The <code>.env.template</code> file is a template file with environment variables that get injected into running containers during development. This file should be copied into the AWS config bucket created after filling in sensitive information (replacing all <code>PLACEHOLDER</code> values with appropriate values for your AWS setup). When provisioning this file is copied to the development environment and injected into containers with <code>docker-compose</code>.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In addition to setting up an AWS account, you must register for an Auth0 account to produce secrets to use in the <code>.env</code> file. You need to go through setting up an application and copying over the client IDs, domain, and secret.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Additionally, if you want to exercise token management in the application, you need to generate a management API app to handle managing the generation of <a href=\"https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/tokens\" rel=\"nofollow\">refresh tokens for users via the management API</a>. This is not necessary for most functionality in the application and can be deferred until later if you desire.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The last thing to set up with Auth0 are the allowed callback URLs and logout URLs. These need to be edited to allow interaction for local development from <code>localhost:9091</code> and <code>localhost:9100</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-heading\" dir=\"auto\"><h3 class=\"heading-element\" dir=\"auto\">Development</h3><a id=\"user-content-development\" class=\"anchor\" aria-label=\"Permalink: Development\" href=\"#development\"><svg class=\"octicon octicon-link\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z\"></path></svg></a></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Raster Foundry follows the approach outlined <a href=\"https://githubengineering.com/scripts-to-rule-them-all/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> (\"Scripts to Rule Them All\") to have a  mostly consistent development experience. We deviate in a few specific ways:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>We don't pin / require a specific Java version. The application will eventually run in a jdk8 container, and for reproduction it's helpful to have <code>jabba</code> to be able to describe issues that occur on some Java versions but not others, but largely this does not make a difference at this point.</li>\n<li>We expect the user to install <code>jabba</code> on their host, instead of running everything in containers. Users <em>can</em> choose to run everything in containers, but that's not how the development environment is organized by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Almost all interaction with consoles and servers can be managed via calls to a script located in <code>./scripts</code>. Default values for the S3 config and data buckets in addition to AWS profile will be used if they are not set with an environment variable. Before running <code>scripts/bootstrap</code>, these should be injected into your shell environment:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" dir=\"auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"export RF_AWS_PROFILE=raster-foundry\nexport RF_SETTINGS_BUCKET=rasterfoundry-development-config-us-east-1\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">export</span> RF_AWS_PROFILE=raster-foundry\n<span class=\"pl-k\">export</span> RF_SETTINGS_BUCKET=rasterfoundry-development-config-us-east-1</pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">After exporting your environment settings, you are ready to get started:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" dir=\"auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"$ ./scripts/bootstrap\n$ ./scripts/update\n$ ./scripts/server\"><pre>$ ./scripts/bootstrap\n$ ./scripts/update\n$ ./scripts/server</pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The servers should come up successfully.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Then, kill your servers. To get the database loaded with sample data, you can run <code>./scripts/load_development_data --download</code>.\nThis will fetch a database dump from S3 and some development images. You can use these data for consistent testing instructions\nwith other developers. This script will also apply any outstanding migrations not present in the dev database.</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-heading\" dir=\"auto\"><h3 class=\"heading-element\" dir=\"auto\">Migrations</h3><a id=\"user-content-migrations\" class=\"anchor\" aria-label=\"Permalink: Migrations\" href=\"#migrations\"><svg class=\"octicon octicon-link\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z\"></path></svg></a></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Database migrations are managed using <a href=\"flyway\">flyway</a>.
