Why can't a notebook\ntool have modern editing capabilities like those you'd find in an IDE? Polynote provides useful autocomplete,\nparameter hints, and more – we're planning to add even more features, like jump-to-definition.</li>\n<li><em>Text editing</em> – you can use the WYSIWYG editor for composing text cells, so you'll know what the text will look like as\nyou're writing. TeX equations are also supported.</li>\n<li><em>Multi-language support</em> – Polynote allows you to mix multiple languages in one notebook, while sharing definitions\nseamlessly between them.</li>\n<li><em>Runtime insight</em> – Polynote tries to keep you informed of what's going on at runtime:\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>The tasks area shows you what the kernel is doing at any given time.</li>\n<li>The symbol table shows you what variables and functions you've defined, so you don't have to scroll around to remind yourself.</li>\n<li>Compile failures and runtime exceptions are highlighted in the editor (for supported languages), so you can see exactly what's going wrong.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</article></div>",
