An module marked 'may change' doesn't have to obey the rule of staying binary compatible between minor releases. Breaking API changes may be introduced in minor releases without notice as we refine and simplify based on your feedback. Additionally such a module may be dropped in major releases without prior deprecation.",

Breaking API changes may be introduced in minor releases without notice as we refine and simplify based on your feedback. An experimental module may be dropped in major releases without prior deprecation.",
