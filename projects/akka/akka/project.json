This model is a perfect match for the principles laid out in the <a href=\"https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reactive Manifesto</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">For resilience, we adopt the \"Let it crash\" model which the telecom industry has used with great success to build applications that self-heal and systems that never stop.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Actors also provide the abstraction for transparent distribution and the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Learn more at <a href=\"https://akka.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">akka.io</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-heading\" dir=\"auto\"><h2 class=\"heading-element\" dir=\"auto\">Reference Documentation</h2><a id=\"user-content-reference-documentation\" class=\"anchor\" aria-label=\"Permalink: Reference Documentation\" href=\"#reference-documentation\"><svg class=\"octicon octicon-link\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z\"></path></svg></a></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The reference documentation is available at <a href=\"https://doc.akka.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">doc.akka.io</a>,\nfor <a href=\"https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/scala.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scala</a> and <a href=\"https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/java.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Java</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-heading\" dir=\"auto\"><h2 class=\"heading-element\" dir=\"auto\">Current versions of all Akka libraries</h2><a id=\"user-content-current-versions-of-all-akka-libraries\" class=\"anchor\" aria-label=\"Permalink: Current versions of all Akka libraries\" href=\"#current-versions-of-all-akka-libraries\"><svg class=\"octicon octicon-link\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z\"></path></svg></a></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The current versions of all Akka libraries are listed on the <a href=\"https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-dependencies/current/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Akka Dependencies</a> page.
