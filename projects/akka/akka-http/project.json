It's not a web-framework but rather a more\ngeneral toolkit for providing and consuming HTTP-based services. While\ninteraction with a browser is of course also in scope it is not the primary\nfocus of Akka HTTP.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Akka HTTP follows a rather open design and many times offers several different\nAPI levels for \"doing the same thing\". You get to pick the API level of\nabstraction that is most suitable for your application. This means that, if you\nhave trouble achieving something using a high-level API, there's a good chance\nthat you can get it done with a low-level API, which offers more flexibility but\nmight require you to write more application code.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Learn more at <a href=\"https://akka.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">akka.io</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-heading\" dir=\"auto\"><h2 class=\"heading-element\" dir=\"auto\">Documentation</h2><a id=\"user-content-documentation\" class=\"anchor\" aria-label=\"Permalink: Documentation\" href=\"#documentation\"><svg class=\"octicon octicon-link\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z\"></path></svg></a></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The documentation is available at\n<a href=\"https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-http/current/\" rel=\"nofollow\">doc.akka.io</a>, for\n<a href=\"https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-http/current/scala/http/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scala</a> and\n<a href=\"https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-http/current/java/http/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Java</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-heading\" dir=\"auto\"><h2 class=\"heading-element\" dir=\"auto\">Current versions of all Akka libraries</h2><a id=\"user-content-current-versions-of-all-akka-libraries\" class=\"anchor\" aria-label=\"Permalink: Current versions of all Akka libraries\" href=\"#current-versions-of-all-akka-libraries\"><svg class=\"octicon octicon-link\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z\"></path></svg></a></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The current versions of all Akka libraries are listed on the <a href=\"https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-dependencies/current/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Akka Dependencies</a> page.
